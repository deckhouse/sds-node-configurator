  # Do NOT change to "Fail" under any circumstances.

  # When the scheduler-extender pod is (re)scheduled after restart/failure, the extender is not ready.
  # With "Fail", kube-scheduler gets an error and refuses to schedule its own pod → pod stays Pending → extender never starts → scheduler can't schedule anything.
  # Deadlock: pod never runs.
